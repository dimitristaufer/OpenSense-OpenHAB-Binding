# Things

Things are the entities that can physically be added to a system and which can potentially provide many functionalities in one. It is important to note that Things do not have to be devices, but they can also represent a web service or any other manageable source of information and functionality. From a user perspective, they are relevant for the setup and configuration process, but not for the operation.
